Cordova Kiosk Mode
==================

Cordova plugin to create Cordova application with "kiosk mode".
App with this plugin can be set as Android launcher.
If app starts as launcher, it blocks hardware buttons and statusbar,
so the user cannot close the app until the app request it.

**Note for iOS:** This plugin is for Android only for now. Support of iOS would be useless, because this feature is built in iOS as Guided Access (see Settings - General - Accessibility - Guided Access)
